program that make weird resizing effect on video in discord

but mainly it's just source files, this one only makes video get bigger to end

resizing function is in first lines so it's easy to edit
 <br/><br/>
 how to use:
 
drag video file onto this exe and it opens cmd that tells you progress

to edit resulting resizing edit calcFramSize function, in there it's pretty obvious what to change

and also i think there are still some bugs mainly of my lack of c++ knowledge
 
 <br/><br/>
 
Made in Visual Studio 2019 

actually my first real project in c++

i didn't bother licensing it, it's extremely inefficient code
if u fix it and i'd apreciate crediting

this low priority side project so i won't bother updating it
